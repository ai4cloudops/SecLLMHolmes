However, the user input is not properly sanitized, which means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code into the query.\n\nFor example, if the user input is `' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE books; --`, the resulting SQL query would be:\n```sql\nDELETE FROM books WHERE title = ' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE books; --'\n```\nThis query would delete all books from the `books` table, which is not the intended behavior.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the user input should be properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query. One way to do this is to use prepared statements, which allow you to pass the user input as a parameter to the query, rather than including it directly in the query string. For example:\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef delete_book(user_input):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute(\"DELETE FROM books WHERE title = ?\", (user_input,))\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n```\nThis code uses a prepared statement to pass the user input as a parameter to the `DELETE` query, which helps to prevent SQL injection attacks.",

In Python, you can use the `cursor.execute` method with a parameterized query to execute a SQL query with user-supplied input. For example:\n```\ndef createQuery(username, password):\n  query_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s\"\n  parameters = (username, password)\n  query = query_text, parameters\n  return query\n```\nThis code uses a parameterized query to execute a SQL query with user-supplied input. The `parameters` variable is a tuple of values that will be substituted for the `%s` placeholders in the SQL query. This helps to prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that user-supplied input is properly escaped and cannot be used to execute arbitrary SQL code.",
