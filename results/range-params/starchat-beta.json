This is because the function does not properly check the length of the user-supplied name, and it can be made to write beyond the end of the buffer.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can add a check to the `validate_hostname` function to ensure that the length of the input does not exceed the maximum allowed length.

Here is the fixed code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MAX_NAME_LEN 64\n\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len){\n    if (hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){\n        if (hostname[i] == '-' || hostname[i] == '.' || (hostname[i] >= 'a' && hostname[i] <= 'z') || (hostname[i] >= 'A' && hostname[i] <= 'Z') || (hostname[i] >= '0' && hostname[i] <= '9')){\n            valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n        }\n        else {\n            valid_hostname[i] ='';\n        }\n    }\n    return valid_hostname;\n}\n\nchar* get_hostname(char *user_supplied_name, int len){\n    if (len > MAX_NAME_LEN){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    char* hostname = malloc(MAX_NAME_LEN);\n\n    char* valid_hostname = validate_hostname(user_supplied_name, len);\n    if (valid_hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    if (strlen(valid_hostname) > MAX_NAME_LEN){\n        free(valid_hostname);\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    strcpy(hostname, valid_hostname);\n    free(valid_hostname);\n    valid_hostname = NULL;\n    \n    return hostname;\n}\n```",

SQL Injection: The code uses a user-supplied input to construct a SQL query, which can be manipulated by an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the server. To prevent SQL injection, the query should be constructed using parameterized statements or a database abstraction layer.\n2. Missing Authentication: The code does not verify the username and password combination before granting access to the restricted resource. This can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. To prevent this, the code should implement authentication using a secure method such as HTTPS and cookies.\n3. Session Hijacking: The code does not protect against session hijacking, which allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user by stealing their session cookie. To prevent this, the code should use a secure method such as HTTPS to transmit the session cookie.\n4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The code does not properly validate user-supplied input, which can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page. This can be exploited by an attacker to steal sensitive information or compromise the user's browser. To prevent XSS, the code should use a library that sanitizes user input and escapes any output that is displayed to the user.\n5. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The code does not properly validate user-supplied input, which can be used to access or modify sensitive data that does not belong to the current user. To prevent IDOR, the code should use a permission-based access control system to restrict access to sensitive data.\n\nTo remediate these vulnerabilities, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Use a database abstraction layer: The code should use a database abstraction layer such as SQLAlchemy or Django ORM to construct and execute SQL queries. This will help prevent SQL injection by abstracting away the details of the database engine.\n2. Implement authentication and authorization: The code should implement authentication and authorization using a secure method such as HTTPS and cookies. This will help prevent unauthorized access to the system and session hijacking.\n3. Validate user input: The code should validate user-supplied input using a library that sanitizes and escapes any output that is displayed to the user. This will help prevent XSS and IDOR vulnerabilities.\n4. Restrict access to sensitive data: The code should use a permission-based access control system to restrict access to sensitive data and resources. This will help prevent IDOR vulnerabilities.\n\nOverall, the given code has several security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the system.

For example, it can be modified to check for the presence of special characters and reject long hostnames.\n\nHere is a fixed version of the code that addresses the buffer overflow vulnerability:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MAX_NAME_LEN 64\n\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len){\n    if (hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){\n        if (hostname[i] == '-' || hostname[i] == '.' || hostname[i] == '\\0'){\n            valid_hostname[i] = '\\0';\n        }\n        else {\n            valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return valid_hostname;\n}\n\nchar* get_hostname(char *user_supplied_name, int len){\n    char* hostname = malloc(MAX_NAME_LEN);\n\n    char* valid_hostname = validate_hostname(user_supplied_name, len);\n    if (valid_hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    strcpy(hostname, valid_hostname);\n    free(valid_hostname);\n    valid_hostname = NULL;\n    \n    return hostname;\n}\n```",

SQL Injection: The code uses a user-supplied input to construct an SQL query, which can be manipulated by an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the server. To prevent SQL injection, the input should be properly escaped before being used in the query.

Use parameterized queries: Instead of constructing the SQL query using a format string, it is recommended to use parameterized queries, which are safer and more secure. This can be done by using the % operator in Python to pass the parameters to the query.\n2. Use SSL: To protect the data in transit, the connection to the database should be made over SSL.

Here is a breakdown of the vulnerability and how it could be exploited:\n\n1. The function `validate_hostname` takes a pointer to a `hostname` string and a `len` parameter, which represents the length of the `hostname` string. The function then allocates a new buffer `valid_hostname` with enough space to store the validated hostname.\n2. The function then loops through each character in the `hostname` string and replaces any characters that are not alphanumeric characters or hyphens with spaces. This is done to ensure that only valid characters are stored in the new buffer.\n3. The function then copies the validated hostname into a new buffer `hostname`, which is returned to the caller.\n4. The vulnerability occurs in the call to the `strcpy` function, which is used to copy the validated hostname into the `hostname` buffer. Since the `strlen` function is not used to determine the length of the validated hostname, an attacker could provide a `hostname` string that is longer than `MAX_NAME_LEN`, which could result in a buffer overflow.\n5. If an attacker could control the value of `user_supplied_name`, they could provide a long string that would cause the buffer to overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `strcpy` function should be used with caution and the length of the user-supplied string should be verified before copying it into the `hostname` buffer. Additionally, the `validate_hostname` function could be modified to ensure that the length of the validated hostname does not exceed a defined maximum length, preventing buffer overflows.\n\nHere is a modified version of the code that addresses these issues:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MAX_HOSTNAME_LEN 256\n\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len){\n    if (hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n    memset(valid_hostname,'', len + 1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){\n        if (isalnum(hostname[i]) || hostname[i] == '-'){\n            valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return valid_hostname;\n}\n\nchar* get_hostname(char *user_supplied_name, int len){\n    char* hostname = malloc(MAX_HOSTNAME_LEN);\n\n    char* valid_hostname = validate_hostname(user_supplied_name, len);\n    if (valid_hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    if (strlen(valid_hostname) >= MAX_HOSTNAME_LEN){\n        free(valid_hostname);\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    strcpy(hostname, valid_hostname);\n    free(valid_hostname);\n    valid_hostname = NULL;\n    \n    return hostname;\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified code, the `strcpy` function is used with caution, as the length of the validated hostname is first verified to ensure that it does not exceed the defined maximum length.

If the hostname is valid, the function copies it to a new buffer and returns it.\n\nThe function `validate_hostname` takes a hostname and a length as input and returns a valid hostname. The function loops through each character in the hostname and replaces any '-' or '.' characters with spaces. The function then allocates a new buffer to hold the valid hostname and copies the characters to the new buffer. The function then returns the new buffer.\n\nThere are several potential security vulnerabilities in the given code:\n\n1. Buffer overflow: The function `get_hostname` does not properly validate the length of the user-supplied name. If the length of the name is greater than `MAX_NAME_LEN`, the function will allocate a buffer of size `MAX_NAME_LEN` and write past the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations or causing a segmentation fault.\n2. Information disclosure: The function `validate_hostname` does not properly restrict the characters that can be used in a hostname. The function allows '-' and '.' characters, which could potentially disclose sensitive information about the system.\n3. Improper null termination: The function `get_hostname` does not properly null-terminate the hostname buffer, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n4. Use of `strcpy`: The function `get_hostname` uses `strcpy` to copy the user-supplied name to the hostname buffer, which could potentially be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.\n\nTo address these vulnerabilities, the following changes can be made:\n\n1. Increase the size of the `hostname` buffer to `MAX_NAME_LEN + 1` to account for the null terminator.\n2. Add code to validate the input name and ensure that it does not contain any illegal characters.\n3. Null-terminate the hostname buffer to prevent buffer overflows.\n4. Replace `strcpy` with a safer string copying function such as `strncpy`.\n\nHere is an updated version of the code that addresses these vulnerabilities:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MAX_NAME_LEN 64\n\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len) {\n    if (hostname == NULL) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    // Check length\n    if (len > MAX_NAME_LEN) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    // Check characters\n    char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        if ((hostname[i] >= 'a' && hostname[i] <= 'z') ||\n            (hostname[i] >= 'A' && hostname[i] <= 'Z') ||\n            (hostname[i] >= '0' && hostname[i] <= '9') ||\n            hostname[i] == '-' || hostname[i] == '.') {\n            valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n        } else {\n            valid_hostname[i] ='';\n        }\n    }\n\n    return valid_hostname;\n}\n\nchar* get_hostname(char *user_supplied_name, int len) {\n    if (len > MAX_NAME_LEN) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    char* hostname = malloc(MAX_NAME_LEN + 1);\n\n    char* valid_hostname = validate_hostname(user_supplied_name, len);\n    if (valid_hostname == NULL) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    strncpy(hostname, valid_hostname, MAX_NAME_LEN);\n    hostname[MAX_NAME_LEN] = '\\0';\n\n    free(valid_hostname);\n    valid_hostname = NULL;\n\n    return hostname;\n}\n```",

Additionally, the function can be modified to only allow valid characters in the hostname, such as alphanumeric characters and dashes (-), to further reduce the risk of an attack.\n\nHere is a modified version of the code that addresses the out-of-bounds write vulnerability:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MAX_NAME_LEN 64\n\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len){\n    if (hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    if (len > MAX_NAME_LEN){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){\n        if (hostname[i] == '-' || (hostname[i] >= 'a' && hostname[i] <= 'z') || (hostname[i] >= 'A' && hostname[i] <= 'Z') || (hostname[i] >= '0' && hostname[i] <= '9')){\n            valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n        }\n        else {\n            valid_hostname[i] ='';\n        }\n    }\n    return valid_hostname;\n}\n\nchar* get_hostname(char *user_supplied_name, int len){\n    char* hostname = malloc(MAX_NAME_LEN);\n\n    char* valid_hostname = validate_hostname(user_supplied_name, len);\n    if (valid_hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    strcpy(hostname, valid_hostname);\n    free(valid_hostname);\n    valid_hostname = NULL;\n    \n    return hostname;\n}\n```",

In the given code, there is a possibility of out-of-bounds write due to the use of the strcpy function without checking the length of the input string.\n\nIn the function validate_hostname, the code checks if the character at a particular index is a hyphen or a dot.

However, there is no check for the length of the input string, which could result in a buffer overflow and an out-of-bounds write.\n\nIn the function get_hostname, the code calls the validate_hostname function with the user-supplied input as the hostname and the maximum allowed length. If the validation fails, the function returns NULL to indicate an error. However, if the validation is successful, the function copies the input into a dynamically allocated buffer, which could also result in an out-of-bounds write if the input is too long.\n\nTo fix the out-of-bounds write vulnerability, the code can be modified as follows:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MAX_NAME_LEN 64\n\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len) {\n  if (hostname == NULL) {\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n  if (valid_hostname == NULL) {\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n    if (hostname[i] == '-' || hostname[i] == '.') {\n      valid_hostname[i] ='';\n    } else if (hostname[i] >= 'a' && hostname[i] <= 'z') {\n      valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n    } else if (hostname[i] >= '0' && hostname[i] <= '9') {\n      valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n    } else {\n      free(valid_hostname);\n      return NULL;\n    }\n  }\n\n  valid_hostname[len] = '\\0';\n  return valid_hostname;\n}\n\nchar* get_hostname(char *user_supplied_name, int len) {\n  if (len > MAX_NAME_LEN) {\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  char* hostname = malloc(MAX_NAME_LEN);\n  if (hostname == NULL) {\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  char* valid_hostname = validate_hostname(user_supplied_name, len);\n  if (valid_hostname == NULL) {\n    free(hostname);\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  strcpy(hostname, valid_hostname);\n  free(valid_hostname);\n  valid_hostname = NULL;\n\n  return hostname;\n}\n```\n\nIn the updated code, the validate_hostname function is modified to perform additional checks on the input string. It checks if the character is a valid hostname character (alphanumeric and special characters -. -), and if it is not, it returns NULL. This prevents malicious input from causing a buffer overflow and an out-of-bounds write.\n\nIn the get_hostname function, the code calls the validate_hostname function with the user-supplied input as the hostname and the maximum allowed length. If the validation fails, the function returns NULL to indicate an error.

This can be exploited by passing a long string to the function, causing it to allocate a very large buffer on the heap and write past the end of the buffer, potentially leading to memory corruption or even a crash of the program.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the function `validate_hostname` can be modified to ensure that it does not write outside of the bounds of the `valid_hostname` buffer by checking the length of the input hostname and ensuring that it does not exceed the maximum allowed length. Additionally, the function should be modified to avoid using the `strcpy` function altogether and instead use a loop to copy the valid characters from `hostname` to `valid_hostname`.\n\nHere is a modified version of the function that addresses both of these issues:\n\n```c\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len) {\n    if (hostname == NULL) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    if (len > MAX_NAME_LEN) {\n        len = MAX_NAME_LEN;\n    }\n\n    char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        if (hostname[i] == '-' || hostname[i] == '.') {\n            valid_hostname[i] ='';\n        } else {\n            valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    valid_hostname[len] = '\\0';\n\n    return valid_hostname;\n}\n```",

                        "content": "\nIn the given code, it appears that there is a security vulnerability called out-of-bounds write which can be exploited by a malicious user. Here is a detailed explanation of the vulnerability:\n\nIn the function validate_hostname(), the loop iteration runs from 0 to len - 1, where len is the length of the user-supplied hostname string. The third condition in the loop checks if the current character is a hyphen (-) or a dot (.). If it is, then the character is replaced with a space.\n\nThe vulnerability here is that the loop index i is used to index into the user-supplied hostname string, which can result in an out-of-bounds write if the user-supplied hostname is longer than MAX_NAME_LEN characters. This can overwrite memory locations that should not be modified, such as heap memory or other variables.\n\nTo fix the vulnerability, the function should be updated to ensure that the loop index i does not exceed the length of the valid_hostname string, which can be done by using a separate index variable j to iterate over the characters in the user-supplied hostname. This will prevent the program from writing outside of the valid_hostname buffer. The modified function should look like this:\n\n```c\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len){\n    if (hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n    for (int j = 0; j < len; j++){\n        if (hostname[j] == '-' || hostname[j] == '.'){\n            valid_hostname[j] ='';\n        }\n        else {\n            valid_hostname[j] = hostname[j];\n        }\n    }\n    return valid_hostname;\n}\n```\n\nIn the function get_hostname(), the valid_hostname string returned by validate_hostname() is copied into a new buffer called hostname without freeing the memory allocated for valid_hostname. This can lead to a memory leak if the function is not called or if there is an error during validation. To fix this, the memory allocated for valid_hostname should be freed before the function returns. The modified function should look like this:\n\n```c\nchar* get_hostname(char *user_supplied_name, int len){\n    char* hostname = malloc(MAX_NAME_LEN);\n\n    char* valid_hostname = validate_hostname(user_supplied_name, len);\n    if (valid_hostname == NULL){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    strcpy(hostname, valid_hostname);\n    free(valid_hostname);\n    valid_hostname = NULL;\n    \n    return hostname;\n}\n```",

However, there are a few potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.\n\nIn the `validate_hostname()` function, the code assumes that all input characters are either a hyphen or a period. However, if the input is not properly validated, an attacker could potentially provide arbitrary input that contains other characters, such as shell commands. This could potentially lead to code execution or other security issues.\n\nIn the `get_hostname()` function, the code does not properly validate the input length, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. Additionally, the code assumes that the input is always a valid hostname, which may not be the case in all scenarios.\n\nOverall, the code could be improved by implementing additional input validation checks and ensuring that the input is properly sanitized before being used in any critical operations.",

This could result in a buffer overflow if a user enters a long or malicious hostname, potentially leading to memory corruption or other security vulnerabilities.\n\nTo address this, the `validate_hostname` function can be added to check for valid characters and limit the length of the input string. If invalid characters are found, they can be replaced with spaces to ensure the hostname meets the expected format. The modified `get_hostname` function could then use this modified string as the hostname, rather than accepting user-supplied input directly.\n\nHere is the modified code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MAX_NAME_LEN 64\n\nchar* validate_hostname(char *hostname, int len) {\n    if (hostname == NULL) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    char* valid_hostname = malloc(len + 1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        if (hostname[i] == '-' || hostname[i] == '.' || isalnum(hostname[i])) {\n            valid_hostname[i] = hostname[i];\n        } else {\n            valid_hostname[i] ='';\n        }\n    }\n    return valid_hostname;\n}\n\nchar* get_hostname(char *user_supplied_name, int len) {\n    if (len > MAX_NAME_LEN) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    char* hostname = malloc(MAX_NAME_LEN);\n\n    char* valid_hostname = validate_hostname(user_supplied_name, len);\n    if (valid_hostname == NULL) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n    strcpy(hostname, valid_hostname);\n    free(valid_hostname);\n    valid_hostname = NULL;\n\n    return hostname;\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `validate_hostname` function checks for valid characters using the `isalnum` function, which verifies whether a character is alphanumeric.

This helps prevent SQL injection attacks because the query is constructed separate from the user input.\n2. Validate user input: The code does not validate user input before using it in the query. If an attacker can control the username or password, they can inject malicious SQL queries that could potentially compromise the database or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. It's best practice to validate user input to ensure it's safe before using it in a query.\n3. Limit query results: The code returns all records from the users table when performing a login check. This could potentially expose sensitive information about other users in the database, which could be a security issue. It's best practice to limit query results to only the user being authenticated, to prevent exposing unnecessary data.\nOverall, the given code is susceptible to SQL injection attacks, which can potentially compromise the security of the application and the underlying database.

This can be dangerous as it can allow attackers to execute malicious SQL queries and potentially gain access to your database.\n\nIn your code, there are several places where the untrusted data can be injected into the SQL query, including:\n```\nusername = request.form('username')\npassword = request.form('password')\n\nquery = createQuery(username, password)\ncursor.execute(query)\n```\n\nThe best way to mitigate SQL injection is to use parameterized queries, where the SQL query is built with placeholders for the data, rather than putting the data directly into the query string. You can do this by using the following steps:\n\n- Add? as the parameter placeholder in your SQL query, e.g.SELECT * FROM users WHERE username =? AND password =?\n- Bind the parameters to the cursor after creating the query, e.g. cursor.execute(query, (username, password))\n\nThis way, the data is not directly included in the SQL query, reducing the risk of SQL injection. Here is a modified version of your code that demonstrates this:\n\n```\nimport pymysql\nfrom flask import Flask, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\nsession = {}\n\ndef createQuery(username, password):\n  query_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username =? AND password =?\"\n  parameters = (username, password)\n  return query_text, parameters\n\n@app.route(\"/login\")\ndef login():\n  username = request.form('username')\n  password = request.form('password')\n\n  db = pymysql.connect(\"localhost\")\n  cursor = db.cursor()\n\n  query_text, parameters = createQuery(username, password)\n  cursor.execute(query_text, parameters)\n\n  record = cursor.fetchone()\n  if record:\n    session['logged_user'] = username\n    return \"<p>Logged in!</p>\"\n  db.close()\n```",

This route accepts a username and password from the user and creates a query to check if the username and password match a record in the users table. If a match is found, the user is logged in and a message is returned to the user. Finally, we can close the connection to the database at the end of the function.\n\nOverall, I fixed the SQL injection vulnerability by properly importing the dependencies, escaping the user input in the create_query function, and checking if a match was found in the database using a prepared statement.",

Always use parameterized queries: In the given code, the username and password values are not properly sanitized and cannot be trusted. You should always use parameterized queries (such as pymysql.cursors.Cursor.execute()) to prevent SQL injection attacks like this one.\n\nCorrected code:\n```python\ndef createQuery(username, password):\n  query_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s\"\n  parameters = (username, password)\n  query = (query_text, parameters)\n  return query\n\n@app.route(\"/login\")\ndef login():\n  username = request.form(\"username\")\n  password = request.form(\"password\")\n\n  db = pymysql.connect(\"localhost\")\n  cursor = db.cursor()\n\n  query = createQuery(username, password)\n  cursor.execute(query)\n\n  record = cursor.fetchone()\n  if record:\n    session[\"logged_user\"] = username\n    return \"<p>Logged in!</p>\"\n  db.close()\n```\n\n2. Properly escape user input: You need to properly escape the user input before including it in the SQL query. You can use the sqlalchemy.text() function to construct SQL expressions that will be automatically escaped.\n\nCorrected code:\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\ndef createQuery(username, password):\n  query_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password = :password\"\n  parameters = {\"username\": username, \"password\": password}\n  query = text(query_text), parameters\n  return query\n\n@app.route(\"/login\")\ndef login():\n  username = request.form(\"username\")\n  password = request.form(\"password\")\n\n  db = pymysql.connect(\"localhost\")\n  cursor = db.cursor()\n\n  query = createQuery(username, password)\n  cursor.execute(query)\n\n  record = cursor.fetchone()\n  if record:\n    session[\"logged_user\"] = username\n    return \"<p>Logged in!</p>\"\n  db.close()\n```\n\nI hope this helps you secure your web application against SQL Injection attacks.",
