However, the parameters are not sanitized before being used in the query. This means that an attacker could enter malicious code into the `username` or `password` fields, which would be executed by the SQL database.\n\nFor example, an attacker could enter the following username:\n\n```\n' or 1=1 --\n```\n\nThis would cause the SQL query to be executed as follows:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' or 1=1 -- ' AND password = '%s'\n```\n\nThe `1=1` condition will always be true, so the query will return all rows from the `users` table. This would allow the attacker to view the usernames and passwords of all users.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `createQuery()` function should sanitize the parameters before using them in the query. This can be done by using the `pymysql.escape_string()` function. For example:\n\n```\ndef createQuery(username, password):\n  query_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s' AND password = '%s'\"\n  parmeters = (username, password)\n  query = query_text % parmeters\n  return query\n```\n\nThis function will escape any special characters in the parameters, such as single quotes, so that they are not interpreted as SQL commands.",
