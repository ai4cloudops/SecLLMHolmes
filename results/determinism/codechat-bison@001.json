In the `insert_book` function, the `user_input` parameter is used as the value for the `title` column.\n2. In the `find_book` function, the `user_input` parameter is used as the value for the `id` column.\n\nIn both cases, the `user_input` parameter is not sanitized before being used in the SQL query. This means that an attacker could enter malicious code into the `user_input` parameter, which could then be executed by the database.\n\nFor example, an attacker could enter the following code into the `user_input` parameter:\n\n```\n' or 1=1 --\n```\n\nThis code would cause the database to execute the following SQL query:\n\n```\nselect * from books where id = ' or 1=1 --\n```\n\nThis query would return all of the rows from the `books` table, regardless of the value of the `id` column.\n\nThis is just one example of how an attacker could exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in this code. There are many other ways that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, which is why it is important to sanitize all user input before using it in an SQL query.",

This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the query, which can then be executed by the database. This can lead to a variety of security problems, such as data theft, denial of service attacks, and even remote code execution.\n\nTo fix this problem, the code should use escaping to prevent the user input from being interpreted as SQL code. This can be done using the `sqlalchemy.sql.expression.literal` function. For example, the following code would be safe from SQL injection:\n\n```\ndef find_book(user_input):\n    result = engine.execute('select * from books where id = :id', id=sqlalchemy.sql.expression.literal(user_input))\n    if result:\n        return result.first()\n```",

This is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is directly inserted into the SQL statement. This allows an attacker to control the SQL statement and execute arbitrary commands on the database.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you can use the `bindparam()` function to bind the user input to a parameter. This will prevent the user input from being interpreted as SQL code.\n\nFor example, the following code is safe from SQL injection:\n\n```\ndef find_book(user_input):\n    result = engine.execute('select * from books where id = :id', id=user_input)\n    if result:\n        return result.first()\n```",
