The main issue is in the `createQuery()` function where string formatting (`%` operator) is used to directly insert user input into the SQL query string.\n\nHere's why it's problematic:\n\n1. The function builds the query by directly interpolating the username and password values into the query string using string formatting (`%`).\n\n2. An attacker could input malicious values like:\n   Username: `admin' --`\n   Password: `anything`\n\n   This would result in a query like:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything'\n   ```\n   The `--` comments out the rest of the query, potentially allowing unauthorized access.\n\nTo fix this, you should use parameterized queries instead:\n\n```python\ndef createQuery(cursor, username, password):\n    query_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s\"\n    cursor.execute(query_text, (username, password))\n```\n\nUsing parameterized queries lets the database driver properly escape values and prevent SQL injection attacks. The database will treat the parameters as data rather than potentially executable SQL code.",
