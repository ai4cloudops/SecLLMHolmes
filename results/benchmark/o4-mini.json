You check that the incoming string is strictly shorter than MAX_SIZE:\n   ```c\n   if (MAX_SIZE <= strlen(user_supplied_string)) {\n       exit(1);\n   }\n   ```\n   So the user string is at most 31 bytes long (when MAX_SIZE == 32).\n\n2. You allocate enough room in dst_buf to handle the worst\u2013case expansion of every single input character into \u201c&amp;\u201d (5 bytes each) plus one for the NUL:\n   ```c\n   malloc( (5 * sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE) + 1 );\n   // which for MAX_SIZE == 32 is 5*32 + 1 == 161 bytes\n   ```\n3. In the absolute worst case (user string is 31 bytes all \u201c&\u201d), you\u2019ll expand it to 31 * 5 == 155 bytes, then add 1 for the final '\\0' == 156 bytes total. You have 161 bytes allocated, so you\u2019re still safely inside bounds.\n\nBecause of the strict length check combined with the ample allocation, there is no out-of-bounds write here.  \n\nThat said, a few cleanliness/safety suggestions:\n\n\u2022 Store strlen(user_supplied_string) in a local so you don\u2019t keep calling it inside the loop.  \n\u2022 Always check the return value of malloc for NULL.  \n\u2022 Use size_t for indices and lengths to avoid signed/unsigned mixing.  \n\u2022 If you ever change the expansion logic (e.g. add new entities), remember to revisit the buffer-size calculation accordingly.",

That\u2019s a textbook use\u2010after\u2010free.  \n4.

Free it once **after** the loop (or abort/return immediately after you free it).  \n\u2022 Or better yet, allocate and free inside each iteration (if you really need per\u2010file buffers), or detect the error and `return` before your next use of `data`.  \n\nExample (free once at the end):\n```c\nvoid read_files(int num_files, char **files) {\n    FILE *fp;\n    char *data = malloc(1024);\n    if (!data) { perror(\"malloc\"); return; }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < num_files; i++) {\n        fp = fopen(files[i], \"r\");\n        if (!fp) {\n            printf(\"Error opening file %s\\n\", files[i]);\n            continue;      // skip to next without touching `data`\n        }\n        printf(\"File %s:\\n\", files[i]);\n        while (fgets(data, 1024, fp)) {\n            printf(\"%s\", data);\n        }\n        fclose(fp);\n    }\n\n    free(data);\n}\n```\nThis way `data` remains valid throughout all `fgets` calls, and you only free it once.",

The culprit is the way you use strncpy() and then immediately call strncat() without ever guaranteeing a NUL terminator inside buf.\n\nWalk through what actually happens:\n\n1. you allocate  \n        char buf[3];  \n   so valid indices are buf[0], buf[1], buf[2].\n\n2. you do  \n        strncpy(buf, \"1\", 1);  \n   strncpy(\u2026, n) will copy exactly n bytes from the source, and if the source is at least n bytes long it does **not** append a `'\\0'`.  \n   Here, n == 1 and the source `\"1\"` is length 1, so it copies the character `'1'` into buf[0] and writes **no** NUL anywhere.  \n   After that call buf may look like  \n        buf[0] = '1';  \n        buf[1] = ?;    \u2190 uninitialized  \n        buf[2] = ?;    \u2190 uninitialized  \n\n3. you then do  \n        strncat(buf, \"1\", 3);  \n   strncat() assumes that its first argument is a _properly NUL\u2010terminated_ C-string.  It will first scan forward from buf[0] until it finds a `'\\0'` to know where to begin appending.  Because you never put a `'\\0'` in buf, it will happily march past buf[2], running off the end of your array, looking for a terminator.  Once it finally finds one in who-knows-what memory, it will start copying from the second argument and appending a terminator of its own.  You have no control over where that happens, or whether it lands inside your 3-byte array.\n\nAll of that is undefined behavior\u2014and in real code almost certainly will translate into a buffer\u2010overrun.  Even if your particular compiler/runtime \u201chappens\u201d to find a zero byte just after buf[2] and so only writes 2 more bytes, that\u2019s pure luck.  You must not rely on it.\n\nHow to fix it?  Either\n\n1. Always NUL-terminate after using strncpy:  \n        strncpy(buf, \"1\", 1);  \n        buf[1] = '\\0';  \n   and then you know buf is a 1-character string and strncat(buf, \u2026, 3) can safely append up to 2 more characters (you only append 1 anyway).\n\nor\n\n2. Use a safer function that takes the total buffer size:  \n\n        snprintf(buf, sizeof buf, \"%s%s\", \"1\", \"1\");  \n\nor, if your platform has them, use the BSD-style strlcpy/strlcat:\n\n        strlcpy(buf, \"1\", sizeof buf);  \n        strlcat(buf, \"1\", sizeof buf);  \n\nEither of these guarantees no reads or writes past buf[0..2].",

Always use `fgets(file_name, sizeof file_name, stdin)`.  \n   - You return `file_name` (a local array) from `get_file_name()`, which is undefined behavior.  \n   - You never free the `resolved_path` from realpath (mem\u00adory leak).  \n   - You compare and then open `path` (user\u2010controlled) rather than opening the already\u2010canonicalized `resolved_path`.  If you had used `open(resolved_path, \u2026 O_NOFOLLOW)`, you\u2019d close the TOCTOU hole.  \n\nBottom line:  \n   \u2022 There is *no* simple \u201c../\u201d bypass because of the realpath()+prefix\u2010check.  \n   \u2022 However, the TOCTOU symlink swap circumvents it, so in practice an attacker with write access inside `/home/users/user1` can still make you open arbitrary files.  \n   \u2022 And beyond path traversal, the use of `gets()` and returning a stack pointer are completely fatal bugs in their own right.",

Or use a bounded copy like strncpy/strlcpy:\n\n       char *new_data = malloc(100);\n       if (!new_data) /* handle error */;\n       strncpy(new_data, data, 99);\n       new_data[99] = '\\0';    // guarantee nul-termination\n\nEither of those will eliminate the unbounded write.",

You\u2019re building your own quoted SQL string  \n    ```python\n    query_text = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s' AND password = '%s'\"\n    ```\n    and then shoving user\u2010supplied values straight in.\n\n 2. You never actually call PyMySQL\u2019s parameterized API correctly. You do\n    ```python\n    query = (query_text, (username, password))\n    cursor.execute(query)\n    ```\n    but `cursor.execute()` expects its signature to be\n    ```python\n    cursor.execute(sql_string, parameters_tuple)\n    ```\n    If you pass one tuple to `execute()`, PyMySQL will treat the *entire* tuple as the SQL to execute (no parameter\u2010substitution happens).\n\nA malicious user can set, for example:\n\n   username =   foo' OR '1'='1\n   password =   anything\n\nand turn your query into  \n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users\n WHERE username = 'foo' OR '1'='1'\n   AND password = 'anything'\n```\nwhich will always succeed.\n\nHow to fix it\n-------------\n\nUse proper parameter binding (and don\u2019t put your own quotes around `%s`). For example:\n\n```python\n@app.route(\"/login\", methods=[\"POST\"])\ndef login():\n    username = request.form[\"username\"]\n    password = request.form[\"password\"]\n\n    db     = pymysql.connect(host=\"localhost\", user=\"\u2026\", passwd=\"\u2026\", db=\"\u2026\")\n    cursor = db.cursor()\n\n    sql   = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=%s AND password=%s\"\n    args  = (username, password)\n    cursor.execute(sql, args)\n\n    user = cursor.fetchone()\n    if user:\n        session[\"logged_user\"] = username\n        return \"<p>Logged in!</p>\"\n\n    return \"<p>Login failed</p>\", 401\n```\n\nNow PyMySQL will safely escape and quote the two parameters for you, closing the door on SQL\u2010injection.",

On most platforms INT_MAX is much smaller than the maximum size_t, so you have implicitly guaranteed that sizeof(int)*num will fit into an int.  After the usual integer promotions, the multiplication is done in size_t, so as long as sizeof(int)*num \u2264 INT_MAX \u2264 SIZE_MAX the multiplication cannot wrap.  \n\nStrictly speaking, a more correct guard against wrapping in a size_t multiply would be\n\n    if (num < 0 || (size_t)num > SIZE_MAX / sizeof *data_ints)\n        \u2026fail\u2026\n\nbut since num is an int (and thus \u2264 INT_MAX < SIZE_MAX on any sane platform) your check already insures \u201csizeof(int) * num\u201d can\u2019t overflow a size_t.\n\n2) overflow in \u201csum += data_ints[i]\u201d  \n------------------------------------  \nYou do all of your arithmetic into a plain signed int called sum:\n\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (i = 0; i < num; i++)\n        sum += data_ints[i];\n\nIf the user\u2019s input integers (data_ints[i]) or the length num is large enough that the running total ever exceeds INT_MAX or goes below INT_MIN, you invoke _signed_ overflow, which in C is undefined behavior.  That _is_ a potential security problem if an attacker can cause you to wrap your sum back towards zero (or negative or otherwise) and then trust it.\n\nConclusion\n----------  \n1) Your check against `num >= (INT_MAX / sizeof(int))` does indeed prevent the classic \u201cmalloc size multiplication overflows\u201d bug (though the most pedantic fix would compare to `SIZE_MAX / sizeof(int)`), so you do not have a heap\u2010allocation integer\u2010overflow there.  \n2) You _do_ have an unchecked signed\u2010integer overflow in the accumulation loop into `sum`.

You are not going to get a classic string-based path-traversal via \u201c../\u201d here \u2013 you explicitly reject any two consecutive dots \u2013 however there are still some ways this can be bypassed or misused:\n\n1.   Absolute\u2010path tricks  \n     You allow \u2018/\u2019 in the filename, so if someone passes  \n       \u201c/etc/passwd\u201d  \n     you will try to open  \n       \u201c/Users/user1//etc/passwd\u201d  \n     which collapses to \u201c/Users/user1/etc/passwd\u201d on Unix.

If you really want to ban absolute paths, explicitly reject any filename that begins with \u2018/\u2019.\n\n2.   Symlink attacks (TOCTOU)  \n     Even if the user can only request files inside /Users/user1, if they or someone else can race you and swap a harmless file for a symlink to \u201c/etc/shadow\u201d between your checks and the fopen(), you\u2019ll end up following that link and reading outside your sandbox.  Plain string checks can\u2019t stop that.  You either need to open the directory first (openat + O_NOFOLLOW, fstat, verify it lives under /Users/user1, then open the child, etc.) or chroot into /Users/user1 or otherwise tighten the filesystem permissions.\n\n3.   Unicode/encoding tricks  \n     You only look for ASCII-dot ASCII-dot.  If somewhere upstream you URL-decode or normalize things (e.g. \u201c%2e%2e\u201d), it can sneak past your checker.\n\n4.   Edge cases in your loop  \n     You only walk from 0 to strlen(file_name)\u22122, so the last character is never validated.
