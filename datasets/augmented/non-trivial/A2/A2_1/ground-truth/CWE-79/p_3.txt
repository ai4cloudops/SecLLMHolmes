The user input `day` is passed to `vulnerable_func1` and an output is created which consists of the user input `day` with proper escaping as well as the SQL query results. Then the output is reflected back and rendered on the web page, now if the `day` contains malicious scripts, they will be rendered as part of the HTML response but will never be executed when the response is rendered by the browser.
